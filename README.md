=================

Some simplified tools for plotting the results of particle accelerator simulations in Elegant.  These scripts use sddsplot and command line arguments, and assume the default filename options for elegant output, i.e. that the core file is filename.ele, Courant-Snyder/Twiss parameters are filename.twi, etc.  The goal of this is to simplify the plots that are frequently used in diagnostics and studies, while eliminating the need to remember "Which of the output files contains the normalized corrected emittance?  What is its name agian?"
